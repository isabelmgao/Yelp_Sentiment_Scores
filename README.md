# Yelp_Sentiment_Scores
Analyzed reviews from the Yelp Academic Dataset to computer sentiment scores for  businesses. 
A high sentiment score indicated positive reviews and a low (negative) sentiment scores indicated negative reviews about the business. 
With these computed sentiment scores, I compared the scores to the actual star ratings to see how well they correlated using exploratory analysis methods such as linear regression, scatter and hex bin plots, and a Pearson’s correlation test. I completed this using pyspark, running on a hadoop cluster, and also solely using python (no pyspark). Both are included in repo
